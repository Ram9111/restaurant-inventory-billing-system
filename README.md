🍽️ Restaurant Inventory & Billing Management System (Microservices + Kafka)

A backend system designed to digitalize restaurant operations with accurate inventory tracking, automated stock management, and event-driven invoice notification using Apache Kafka. This project follows a microservice architecture, separating the core application and the email notification service.

Core Backend Service

🔐 JWT-based User Authentication

📦 Ingredients Master Management

📘 Recipe Master Management

📊 Stock-In & Stock Movement Tracking

🧮 Billing & Order Processing

🚀 Features and Functionality

Auto stock deduction

Reverse stock logic on order cancel/update

Table-view Stock Report

Includes Excel Export feature

Global Exception Handler

Standardized API error structure

Clean and consistent response format

RESTful API Architecture

MySQL Database with JPA/Hibernate

Email Notification Microservice

Order Invoice Emails

🚚 Connected via Apache Kafka for async, decoupled, and reliable communication

Project Flow (Step-by-Step)

Add Ingredients :- Ingredients are created and managed through the Ingredients Master.

Create Recipes :- Recipes are defined in the Recipe Master by selecting the required ingredients and specifying their measurement quantities.

Manage Stock :- Stock for each ingredient is added through the Stock-In module. Current stock levels can be viewed anytime in the Stock Report.

Create Bill / Place Order :- Orders are generated by selecting recipes and entering the required order quantities.

Order Processing Flow

Order is placed → billing logic runs

Stock deduction or reverse-stock executed

Order invoice event pushed to Kafka topic

Email microservice listens → sends invoice email

⚙️ How to Run the Project 1. Start Zookeeper & Kafka bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties

  Create Kafka Topic kafka-topics.sh --create --topic invoice-topic --bootstrap-server localhost:9092

  Start Core Service mvn spring-boot:run

  Start Email Microservice mvn spring-boot:run

📨 Kafka Configuration Producer (Core Service)

Sends invoice events to topic invoice-topic.

Consumer (Email Service)

Listens using:

@KafkaListener(topics = "invoice-topic", groupId = "email_group")
